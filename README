These are programs i wrote to work with DVDs.

Useful:

- catdvd decrypts dvd-video discs (and dvd-audio if you have a hacked-up libdvdcss)

- extractaudio extracts audio tracks from dvds titles, with correct chapter breaks

Less useful:

- lsdvd lists dvd titles, chapters, and audio tracks

- dvdbreakpoints prints correct chapter breaks for dvd audio tracks

In development:

- ac3strip will eventually strip dynamic range compression from AC-3 files
